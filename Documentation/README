How to run the main function even though the main isnt in the same directory as the library

g++ -I /path/to/eigen/ my_program.cpp -o my_program (General Template on Terminal Command)

g++ -I ~/Documents/Computer_Scripts/C++/Neural_Network/eigen_3.3.9_lib Main.cpp -o Main (Key this into terminal)

./Main (Run the Compiled Executable "Main")

ALternatively, this command points the compiler towards the header files of eigen and so it can compile, Idk how it works but it works in my machine

g++ -I /usr/include/eigen3/ Main.cpp -o Main
